# Sentiment Analysis Web App made with AWS

The purpose of this project in my deep learning course was to learn how to use Amazon Sagemaker to train a machine learning model, and AWS to make a simple web application using the model.  It is a sentiment analysis, that takes in a movie review and determines if the review was positive or negative.  I created and trained the model using a Jupyter Notebook instance in my AWS account.  I created a lambda function to interact with the model with AWS services, and then an API with AWS services to call the lambda function, then connected the API to the web app.

Here are examples of what the completed web app looked like and what it did:
